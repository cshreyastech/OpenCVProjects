Supervised: Find a mapping from input to output
Unsupervised: outputs patterns in the data
Ex: Clustering

Classification vs Regression
Classification: goals is to classify input into different categories
Regression: Predict a number or collection of numbers from input
Deep neural network
Image Classification steps:
step1: preprocessing
step2: Convert the image to feature vector
step3: Pass feature vector to learning algorithm for classification
Hyperplane

Error & loss function L = ei^2 = sum(y - mx)^2
- Gradient Descent
 - Stochastic Gradient Descent
