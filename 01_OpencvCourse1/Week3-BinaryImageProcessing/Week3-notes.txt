Binary Image Processing
----------------------
> Thresholding operations: Converts Gray Scale image to Binary image based on intensity of pixels
- Binary Thresholding
- Inverse Binary Thresholding
- Truncate Thresholding
- Threshold to Zero
- Inverted Threshold to Zero
- Adaptive Thresholding
- Otsu's Thresholding

> Errosion & Dilation: Srink or Expand binary blobs
- Morphological operation
- Dilation: to enlarge
- Errosion: To srink

> When using combination these operations are called opening or closing. Used for removing noise from binary images.
> Simple Blob detectors: Detect blobs of specific charesitics
> Connected component analysis: Labeling blobs. To mention these pixels are together and labeling them.
> contour analysis
