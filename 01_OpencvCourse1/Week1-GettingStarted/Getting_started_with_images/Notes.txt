How are image formed?
3d object, pin hole image plane
focal length: distance between pin hole and image plane
size of the image is propotional to focal length
height propotional to 1 / distance of focal length 
x = f * X / Z
y = f * Y / Z

Optical axis
focus: The point at which the rays parellel to Optical Axis convege on Optical Axis
focal plane: Plane perpendicular to Optical axis and placed at focus 

Digital Images
Bayer Pattern: Number of green pixels twices as many blue and red pixels. Human eye much more sensitive to green light compared to red and blue.
Demosaicing: Two missing challenges in RBG image is calculated using interpolation of neighboring pixels

JPEG: Joint Photographic Expert Group(JPEG)
