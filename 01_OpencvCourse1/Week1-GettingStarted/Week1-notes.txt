Introduction to Computer vision

Image Processing vs Computer Vision
-----------------------------------
Image processig -> input is image output is also an image
Examples
1) Noise reduction
2) Edge detection
3) Image and video compression

Image processing -> input is an image and opuput in an information like features, location, identity
Example: 
1) Face recognition: Input in image and output is identity of the person
2) Object detection: Input is image and output is location of an object and lables of the object

Problems in Computer Vision
---------------------------
1) Image processing
Input is an image and output is filtered version of the image
a) Image denoising
b) Enhancement
c) Restoration

Image and Video Compression
Image binarization and binary image processing
Edge detection / Corner detection

2) 3D reconstruction using 2D images
a) Stereo vision
b) Projector Camera systems

3) Multiple view structure promotion
Structure from Motion
Visual SLAM

3) Shape from Shading
a) Photmetric Stereo

4) Feature detection and matching
a) Image alignment
b) motion estimation

5) Image recogniation
1) Image classification
2) Object detection
3) Object tracking

6) Image Segmention
7) Natural Image matting
